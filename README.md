Automated Testing with Selenium
This workflow will build a Java project in accordance to what has been specified on the requirement document.
You will need to have eclipse /intelli-j installed inorder to be able to run the project locally.
You will also need to download all your selenium jars and store then in a location and extract as it will be a zip file.
Then there after you will need to open up project(right click) to open up properties and click on class path so then your other keys on the right will be enabled.
Once the above step is completed ,you will need to add external jars and to achieve that you will need to go the exact location where your jars were extracted or where you stored them, then select them all and apply and close.
On the project Every action has been done on the main method.
Therefore you will run your project as a java application.
You will need to have Google chrome installed as chromedriver has been used on the project,however that is not the only web browser we can use,there are more options like firefox aswell.
(Opt)To have your project more refined TestNg might need to be installed and Maven so that we can annotate our tests properly so that wwe can also generate a clear report. (I had issues with certifiate as i would have liked to include it as part of project aswell.
All validations and reporting will be diplayed on the console screen of eclipse.
